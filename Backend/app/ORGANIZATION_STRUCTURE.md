# Multi-Tenant Organization Structure Implementation

## Overview
This implementation transforms the ERP system into a multi-tenant architecture where multiple organizations can use the system independently while sharing the same infrastructure.

## Core Architecture

### Organization Entity
- **Primary tenant identifier** for the entire system
- Contains organization details like:
  - Name, description, address, contact info
  - Logo URL and photo URL for branding
  - Business registration and tax identification numbers
  - Active/inactive status
  - Created/updated timestamps

### User-Organization Relationship
- **Many-to-many relationship** between users and organizations
- Users can belong to multiple organizations with different roles
- Organizational roles: OWNER, ADMIN, MANAGER, EMPLOYEE, VIEWER
- Each relationship tracks: join date, active status, role in organization

## Updated Entity Structure

### Core Entities with Organization References
All major entities now include organization references for data isolation:

1. **Branch**
   - Must belong to an organization
   - Organization -> Branches (one-to-many)

2. **Product**
   - Belongs to both branch and organization
   - Organization-level product management

3. **Customer**
   - Belongs to both branch and organization
   - Organization-scoped customer data

4. **Invoice**
   - Organization-scoped billing
   - Maintains branch and organization references

5. **Return**
   - Organization-scoped return management
   - Links to invoices within the organization

6. **ProductCategory**
   - Organization-specific categorization
   - Each org can define their own categories

7. **UserGroup**
   - Organization-scoped customer grouping
   - Custom discount groups per organization

8. **ActionLog**
   - Organization-scoped audit trail
   - Track activities within organizations

9. **Transaction**
   - Organization-scoped financial transactions
   - Complete isolation of financial data

## Repository Layer Updates

### Organization-Filtered Queries
All repositories now include organization-based filtering methods:

- `findByOrganizationId(Long organizationId)`
- `findByOrganizationIdAndActive(Long organizationId, boolean active)`
- `existsBySkuAndOrganizationId(String sku, Long organizationId)`
- `findByIdAndOrganizationId(Long id, Long organizationId)`

### Multi-Tenant Data Access
- Ensures data isolation between organizations
- Prevents cross-organization data access
- Maintains performance with proper indexing

## Service Layer

### OrganizationService
Comprehensive organization management:
- CRUD operations for organizations
- User-organization relationship management
- Organization activation/deactivation
- User role management within organizations

### Data Isolation
All services must filter data by organization:
- Products scoped to organization
- Customers scoped to organization
- Invoices and transactions isolated
- Complete audit trail per organization

## API Layer

### Organization Management Endpoints
```
POST   /api/organizations                    - Create organization
GET    /api/organizations                    - List all organizations
GET    /api/organizations/{id}               - Get organization details
PUT    /api/organizations/{id}               - Update organization
DELETE /api/organizations/{id}               - Delete organization
PUT    /api/organizations/{id}/activate      - Activate organization
PUT    /api/organizations/{id}/deactivate    - Deactivate organization

POST   /api/organizations/users              - Add user to organization
DELETE /api/organizations/users/{userId}/organizations/{orgId} - Remove user
GET    /api/organizations/{orgId}/users      - List organization users
GET    /api/organizations/users/{userId}     - List user organizations
GET    /api/organizations/users/{userId}/organizations/{orgId}/exists - Check membership
```

### Security Considerations
- Role-based access control per organization
- ADMIN and SUPER_ADMIN roles for organization management
- Organization-scoped permissions
- Secure data isolation

## Benefits for ERP Sales

### 1. Complete Data Isolation
- Each organization's data is completely separate
- No risk of data leakage between tenants
- Secure multi-tenancy

### 2. Customizable Branding
- Logo and photo URLs for each organization
- Custom organization information
- Brandable interface per tenant

### 3. Flexible User Management
- Users can work for multiple organizations
- Different roles in different organizations
- Scalable user access management

### 4. Independent Operations
- Each organization operates independently
- Separate product catalogs
- Independent customer bases
- Isolated financial data

### 5. Audit and Compliance
- Complete audit trail per organization
- Organization-specific reporting
- Compliance tracking per tenant

## Migration Requirements

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Add organization_id to all relevant tables
ALTER TABLE branches ADD COLUMN organization_id BIGINT REFERENCES organizations(id);
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN organization_id BIGINT REFERENCES organizations(id);
ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN organization_id BIGINT REFERENCES organizations(id);
-- ... and so on for all entities
```

### Data Migration
- Assign existing data to a default organization
- Update all foreign key relationships
- Ensure data consistency

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
- Organization entity and relationships
- UserOrganization join table with roles
- Updated all core entities with organization references
- Organization repository with filtering methods
- Updated repositories for multi-tenant queries
- Organization service with full CRUD operations
- Organization DTOs (create, update, response)
- Organization controller with REST endpoints
- Exception handling (EntityNotFoundException, DuplicateEntityException)

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Fixing compilation errors in existing services
- Updating existing DTOs to include organization fields
- Service layer updates for organization filtering

### ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks
- Complete service implementations for all entities
- Update existing controllers to use organization filtering
- Security updates for organization-based access control
- Database migration scripts
- Integration tests for multi-tenant functionality
- Documentation updates for API endpoints

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Compilation Errors**: Resolve remaining compilation issues in existing services
2. **Service Updates**: Update all service implementations to use organization filtering
3. **Security Integration**: Implement organization-based security contexts
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of multi-tenant functionality
5. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation with organization examples
6. **Migration Tools**: Create tools for migrating existing single-tenant data

This implementation provides a robust foundation for selling the ERP system to multiple organizations while ensuring complete data isolation and customization capabilities.
